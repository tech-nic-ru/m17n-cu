Description
=============================

The package that you have downloaded contains Church Slavic keyboard drivers
for Intelligent Input Bus (IBus), an input method framework for GNU/Linux and 
other Unix-like Operating Systems. The package works by adding Church Slavic
data to the  m17n library, which realizes multilingualization for 
GNU-Linux/Unix applications.

If you use Microsoft Windows or Apple OS X, this is NOT the package you need. 
Please see http://www.ponomar.net/ for software for other operating systems.

Installation Instructions
=============================

Step 1. Download and install the the ibus-m17n package.
On most distributions, this can be done from the package manager, e.g.:

$ sudo apt-get install ibus-m17n 

Or you can download the latest source code from here:
https://code.google.com/p/ibus/

and follow the installation instructions there.

Step 2. Set IBus to be your default input method
This is done by running:

$ im-config

and selecting ibus

Step 3. Check that your m17n library installation is sane.
The m17n data should be installed in your /usr/share/m17n/ directory:

$ ls /usr/share/m17n/

If not, you will need to find your m17n data directory and modify 
lines 2 and 3 of Makefile in the directory where you downloaded this package.

Step 4. Install the Slavonic m17n data:

In the directory where you have downloaded the files of this package, run:

$ sudo make install

This copies cu-kbd.mim and a number of other data files to your m17n data directory.

Step 5. Log out from your session and log back in.

IBus will re-read the m17n data directory and find the newly installed data files.

Step 6. Load the Slavonic input method

Run:

$ ibus-setup

On the Input Method tab, check Customize active input methods.
Click on Select input method.
Click on Show all input methods.
Scroll down and select: 
* For Church Slavic input method:
   Church Slavic; Old Slavonic; Old Church Slavonic
   Select the kbd (m17n) variant (the only variant currently available)
* For Russian Extended input method:
   Russian
   Select the ext (m17n) variant
Click Add
Click Close

Installation should be complete.

Usage instructions
============================

By default, IBus can be turned off and on by hitting Ctrl+Space.

By default, you can switch between input methods by hitting Ctrl+Shift+Space.

You can customize these keyboard shortcuts by running:

$ ibus-setup

and changing the options on the General tab.

The Slavonic input method is described in detail in
http://www.ponomar.net/files/docen.pdf.

If you are doing serious work typesetting Church Slavic, you should read
our Roadmap for Slavonic Typography in the Unicode Standard, available on
http://www.ponomar.net/

We also suggest installing the Hirmos Ponomar and other Unicode fonts.


Modification instructions
============================

This software is FREE SOFTWARE, and that means that you are free to
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Should you choose to modify the keyboard layout, note that:

The file that contains the input method data is cu-kbd.mim.
It is written in a LIPS-like language.
The format is fairly self-explanatory.
For details, see the m17n library documentation at:
http://www.nongnu.org/m17n/


Uninstallation instructions
============================

Should you wish to remove the software:

Step 1. 

Run 

$ ibus-setup

Go to the Input Method tab
Click on Church Slavic; Old Slavonic; Old Church Slavonic - kbd (m17n); (or Russian - ext (m17n))
Click Remove
Click Close

Step 2.

You can get rid of IBus by running

$ im-config

and selecting a different input method.

Step 3.

You can get rid of the m17n Slavonic data by running:

$ sudo make uninstall

from the directory where you downloaded the source code.

Or you can delete the files by hand from your m17n data directory,
which is usually /usr/share/m17n/

You assume all responsibility for any rm commands you run as sudo.
Please be careful.
